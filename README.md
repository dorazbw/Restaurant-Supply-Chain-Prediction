# Restaurant-Supply-Chain-Prediction
 This project is to forecast the daily demand for lettuce in each fast-food restaurant in different location. The dataset for this project is provided by the largest fast-food chain in United State, which contains multiple dataset for the whole supply chain operation. The data record is from 2015/03 to 2015/06, and we are going to build model and forecasting the next 14 days demand in each store by using Holt-Winters, ETS and ARIMA methods and to find an optimal forecasting method for each store.

There are 4 stores involve in total:
1. Store 46673: Berkeley, California
2. Store 4904: Berkeley, California
3. Store 12631: Ridgewood, New York
4. Store 20974: Elmhurst, New York

There are two methods used through the report. Comparing methods to develop the forecasting is the main purpose for this project, and the forecasting for those four stores are provided at the end of this report.
